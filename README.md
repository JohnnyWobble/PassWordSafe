# PassWordSafe
 This will save your passwords in an ultra-mega secure way, it uses premier etchnoloy such as the patent pending `txt.passwords` file type to store your passwords safely. They won't even have and app to open it!
 
 ## Requirements
This just uses `cryptography` so that is an easy `pip install cryptography` and you are set to go!
(Also uses python3.7)

## Usage
I would suggest on linux adding this to `/usr/local/bin` or just your home folder if you're into that. On windows I guess you could add it to path or put it in your user file. This doe contain a shebang for the universal python(3.7) install, so if you have a vitual env you will need to change it. As a side note this clears your screen to stop people from reading your passwords, but the screen clear doesn't work on the Pycharm run window, so you should run it in the terminal.
